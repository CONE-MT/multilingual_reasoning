# Could Thinking Multilingually Empower LLM Reasoning?

This is the code repository of the paper *Could Thinking Multilingually Empower LLM Reasoning?*.

The `code` folder contains our code used in the paper, where `motivation` corresponds to the upper bound analysis part, and `methods` corresponds to the answer selection strategies part.

The `lm-evaluation-harness` folder is cloned from [the original repo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) and modified to support our experiments. You can run `pip install -e .` under the folder to install it.
